i.) When I included print(print_max) at the end of p13p2,
and ran the program, I was asked to enter 2 numbers as usual,
and it gave the max number. Then, unlike in p13p2, it asked
me to enter 2 numbers again, and gave the max again, and finally it
printed None.

This is because the first call to the function is from p13_2,
then it is called again in the print function, and then the 
print_max has no return value so the default return to 
print is None.

ii.)
If I omit the brackets from the p13p2 code, then nothing happens, as the brackets 
as necessary syntax to run the function.

iii.)
Here, the function runs fine due to the code in p13p2, but then
it prints <function print_max at 0x00BE5150, which seems to
mean that printing the function name without the brackets 
returns the memory address.
