The index expression find the value which is stored in the index position. Counting starts at 0. So animal[1] gave the 2nd letter in 
elephant (in this case 'l'), and the index position [0] gave the first letter ('e'). Even though elephant has 8 letters, asking for
the value at index position [8] will give an error (IndexError: string index out of range), as [8] would refer to a 9th letter. This
is because we start from index position 0. So the 8 letter word would be represented as 0-7 with the index expression.

0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
e	l	e	p	h	a	n	t
